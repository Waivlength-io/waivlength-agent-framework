### **Waivlength Agent Framework (WAF)**

The **Waivlength Agent Framework (WAF)** is a comprehensive architecture for enabling autonomous agents to think, learn, and act within the Waivlength ecosystem. The framework integrates decision-making, extensibility, and learning, with a core focus on evaluating outcomes and adapting over time. Agents operate seamlessly through the **Waivlength App**, where users define high-level goals while agents autonomously determine sub-goals, evaluate progress, and optimize execution.

---

### **1\. Framework Overview**

The Waivlength Agent Framework:

1.  **Enables Autonomous Agents**: Agents evaluate context, assess user-defined goals, and independently determine sub-goals and actions.
2.  **Supports Dynamic Learning**: Success metrics (Standardized Outcome Metrics, SOMs) are refined over time through continuous learning, ensuring agents adapt to evolving needs and environments.
3.  **Integrates Extensions**: Worker agents execute tasks using modular extensions, dynamically selected based on the task at hand.
4.  **Prioritizes Outcome Monitoring**: The framework emphasizes evaluating success over historical and future timelines, allowing agents to refine strategies and decisions.

The **Waivlength App** serves as the client interface for managing spaces, defining goals, and interacting with agent activities. All agent actions, logs, and workflows are visible and controllable through the app.

### **2\. What Is the Framework?**

The Waivlength Agent Framework (WAF) provides:

- **Decision-Making Capabilities**: A structured decision-making loop for agents to evaluate, act, and learn.
- **Extensible Tools**: A modular SDK enabling integration with new extensions and functionalities.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs that allow agents to evaluate outcomes across multiple timelines, supporting reflective learning and dynamic adaptability.
- **Outcome Monitoring Mechanisms**: Systems to track and evaluate task success over time.

The framework bridges the user-defined goals within the **Waivlength App** with the agent's autonomous execution processes, ensuring continuous improvement.

### **3\. Philosophy Behind Waivlength**

The Waivlength Agent Framework is guided by two foundational layers:

#### **1\. The Thinking Layer**

The thinking layer is the cognitive core of the agent. It focuses on:

- **Contextual Evaluation**: Understanding the current state of the Waivlength App Space, user-defined goals, and past actions.
- **Decision-Making**: Evaluating tools, predicting outcomes, and selecting optimal actions.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Adjusting strategies based on feedback and changing environments.

#### **2\. The Learning Layer**

The learning layer is the framework's feedback mechanism, designed to:

- **Refine Metrics Over Time**: Evaluate outcomes against SOMs across historical and future timelines.
- **Enable Continuous Improvement**: Use logs and memories to adapt sub-goals, strategies, and tool usage.
- **Assess Outcomes Across Timelines**: Allow agents to revisit past outcomes, evaluate their long-term success, and refine future actions.

These layers ensure that agents not only act but evolve, becoming more effective with each iteration.

### **4\. Agent Decision-Making Loop**

The **Agent Decision-Making Loop** defines how agents process tasks, learn from results, and refine their actions. It includes:

1.  **Awakening**:\
    The agent is triggered by:

    - Scheduled triggers (e.g., periodic tasks).
    - **Waivlength App Space Events** (e.g., user actions, state changes).
    - External triggers (e.g., API responses, external events).
    - Retriggering for incomplete tasks or pending evaluations.

2.  **Context Gathering**:\
    The agent collects information from:

    - **Waivlength App Space State**: Goals, active tasks, and environmental conditions.
    - **Logging Systems**: Agent Worker Memory, Supervisor Agent Logs, Universal Logs, Delayed Outcomes.
    - **Extensions**: Tools available for execution.

3.  **Goal Assessment**:\
    User-defined goals are broken into sub-goals:

    - Agents dynamically determine sub-goals and define SOMs for measurable success.
    - Timeframes for evaluating outcomes are set, adapting as agents refine their strategies.

4.  **Extension Evaluation**:\
    Worker agents evaluate and select extensions based on:

    - Task relevance.
    - Resource constraints (e.g., budget, permissions).
    - Historical performance metrics.

5.  **Outcome Simulation**:\
    Agents simulate potential results of their actions, choosing the path with the highest probability of success.

6.  **Decision Execution**:\
    Worker agents execute the action using selected extensions, logging inputs, tools used, and immediate confirmations.

7.  **Outcome Observation**:\
    Agents monitor and evaluate results over defined intervals:

    - Snapshots of success metrics are taken across timelines (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
    - Pending outcomes are logged, allowing agents to revisit and evaluate progress over time.

8.  **Learning and Feedback**:\
    Agents update:

    - **Memory Systems**: Tool performance, strategies, and learned outcomes.
    - **Success Metrics**: Refining SOMs based on observed results.

9.  **Return to Non-State**:\
    Agents complete tasks and await the next trigger.

### **5\. Framework Components**

#### **1\. Supervisor and Worker Agents**

- **Supervisor Agents**:

  - Manage high-level goals set in the Waivlength App.
  - Assign tasks to worker agents.
  - Consolidate and refine results over time.

- **Worker Agents**:

  - Execute specific tasks using extensions.
  - Monitor outcomes over timelines.
  - Report results to the Supervisor.

This hierarchy ensures specialization, scalability, and efficient task execution.

---

#### **2\. Extensions**

Extensions are the modular capabilities that worker agents dynamically adopt to perform tasks:

- **SDK Integration**: Developers use the Waivlength SDK to create and register new extensions.
- **Dynamic Selection**: Agents evaluate extensions based on relevance, constraints, and historical success.
- **Execution and Logging**: Worker agents execute tasks through extensions and log their actions for feedback and learning.

---

#### **3\. Logging and Outcome Monitoring**

The framework uses a multi-layered logging system to track and evaluate agent activities:

- **Agent Worker Memory**: Logs worker-specific actions, tools used, and strategies.
- **Supervisor Agent Logs**: Tracks task assignments and outcomes for high-level goals.
- **Universal Logs**: Centralized logging for all agent activities and decisions.
- **Delayed Outcomes**: Logs pending evaluations for actions requiring long-term observation.

Logs allow agents to:

- Monitor outcomes across multiple timelines (e.g., immediate, daily, monthly).
- Revisit past actions to evaluate long-term success or refine strategies.
- Use historical data to adapt to future tasks.

---

#### **4\. Outcome Monitoring**

Outcome monitoring is the core of the framework, enabling agents to:

- Track results over dynamic timeframes.
- Use snapshots to analyze metrics at defined intervals.
- Refine SOMs based on observed patterns and changing contexts.

For example:

- Worker agents revisit outcomes across various timelines (e.g., daily checks for five days, monthly checks for six months).
- Outcomes are flagged as pending until success or failure is determined.
- Supervisors aggregate this data to refine high-level strategies.
